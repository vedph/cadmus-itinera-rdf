These mappings refer to _person items_. A _person item_ is an item representing a person, usually the author of a work. The persons's EID is provided in the item's `MetadataPart`.

## Metadata Part

As for [works](work-mappings.md#metadata-part), we map each person's `eid` metadatum found in its metadata part as the persons's ID. So, the mapping refers to an item's part (the metadata part), rather than directly to the item.

A globally unique URI for the **person** is built as follows:

1. prefix `itn:persons/`;
2. person metadata part's GUID;
3. `/` + person EID (as extracted from the `eid` metadatum).

Here (2) grants the URI's uniqueness, and (1+3) its friendliness.

Also, this node is the subject of a **triple** telling that the person is a CIDOC-CRM _E21 person_.

## Historical Events Part

Other than the person itself, Itinera maps its [events](events.md). The events connected to a person are the backbone of his/her bio.

The general mappings for events apply, using the person-specific thesaurus entries for event types and their related entities.

## Person Works Part

The works by a person. This is an Itinera-specific part, representing a simple list of work IDs with a conventional title and optional assertion, related to the attribution of the work to the corresponding person item. The part model is:

- `works` (`PersonWork[]`):
  - `eid` (`string`)
  - `title`\* (`string`)
  - `assertion` (`Assertion`)

For each **work**:

- CREATION `a E65_Creation`;
- `E65_creation` `P94_has_created` WORK,
- `P14_carried_out_by` PERSON.

This assumes that the person has already been mapped to an entity via its metadata part eid (with a URI equal to `itn:persons/` + metadata part GUID + `/` + EID), while the work entity is created by this mapping, as it has no other source in the database than this relation with its author. This is because such works have no independent existence, as often they are just cited and lost, or the like. So, the work's URI is just `itn:works/` + the person item GUID + `/` + work's EID.

The optional **assertion** is mapped like events assertions.

Also, we need to represent the work's **title**. This can be done in this way:

- TITLE `a E35_title`;
- TITLE `P190_has_symbolic_content` "TITLE VALUE";
- WORK `P102_has_title` TITLE.

### Example

Say we have this **source part**, representing two works assigned to a person (which here is the item); the second work also has an assertion with a couple of citations:

```json
{
  "works": [
    {
      "eid": "alpha",
      "title": "Alpha Work"
    },
    {
      "eid": "beta",
      "title": "Beta Work",
      "assertion": {
        "rank": 2,
        "references": [
          {
            "type": "biblio",
            "citation": "Rossi 1963"
          },
          {
            "type": "ms",
            "citation": "Vat.Lat.123"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The **nodes** generated by [mappings](code/person-mappings.json) are 9:

- for work _alpha_, a creation event, the work itself, and its title;
- for work _beta_ as above, plus an assertion and two citations.

The SID for all these triples is `87654321-4321-4321-cba9876543210/alpha`.

These triples say that:

- a creation event carried out by the person corresponding to the container item has created work alpha;
- work alpha has a title whose value is "Alpha Work";
- a creation event carried out by the person corresponding to the container item has created work beta;
- work beta has a title whose value is "Beta Work";
- the creation event of work beta has probability equal to 2, which is determined with the help of a couple of cited sources (`Rossi 1963` and `Vat.Lat.123`).
